Abstract
Vacuum exhaust performance is a key determinant in the productivity and cost-efficiency of advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Traditional pipe conductance models, which assume isothermal and single-component gas conditions, often lead to 20–30% errors in predicting pumping throughput. These errors drive excessive design margins, oversized pump selections, and rising operational costs.
This paper introduces an integrated simulation framework that combines mixed-gas viscosity (via Herning–Zipperer method), non-isothermal temperature profiles (via thermal relaxation length), and installation-specific geometry (elbows, cones, equivalent lengths) within a unified fixed-point iterative structure. The framework achieves <1% deviation from measured throughput at 1 Torr, validated against experimental data.
In addition, the framework embeds normalized sensitivity analysis, tornado charts, and ±3σ uncertainty propagation to provide intuitive leverage–risk visualization for design decisions. Case studies at the critical 1 Torr operating point demonstrate that pipe diameter dominates conductance sensitivity, while elbow contributions represent the largest resistive share. This modeling standard offers a transparent and reproducible approach for PCS engineers and enables predictive pump sizing across process tools.

1. Introduction
Vacuum pumping systems are central to semiconductor manufacturing, particularly in advanced logic and memory nodes where sub-Torr operating pressures are required. The exhaust line directly determines the achievable chamber pressure, process uniformity, and overall pump utilization efficiency.
Despite their criticality, most industrial vacuum models remain simplistic, relying on isothermal assumptions, single-component gas viscosity, or fixed equivalent lengths for fittings. Such models often incur 20–30% error, forcing design teams to apply ≥30% throughput margins. This leads to habitual oversizing of dry pumps, inflating capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX).
1.1 Previous Work
Early approaches treated vacuum conductance using simplified pipe resistance equations derived from laminar flow theory [1,2]. While useful for educational purposes, these models fail to capture installation-dependent details such as reducers, elbows, and non-isothermal heating effects.
More advanced studies integrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [3,4], but these are computationally expensive and impractical for daily design iterations. Recently, some works incorporated mixed-gas corrections [5,6], yet full industrial adoption is limited due to model complexity and lack of validation against pump curves.
1.2 Gap and Objective
No prior study has systematically:
•	Unified mixed-gas viscosity, non-isothermal effects, and installation geometry in a single iterative model.
•	Validated accuracy to <1% throughput error against measured operating points.
•	Embedded sensitivity and uncertainty quantification for practical decision support.
Objective of this work:
To design a standardized simulation framework for PCS engineers that integrates physics-based models with risk visualization, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and applicability across semiconductor process tools.

2. Methodology
2.1 Governing Equations
Pipe Conductance
For a single pipe element:
Cpipe(P)=π128⋅D4μL⋅PC_{pipe}(P) = \frac{\pi}{128} \cdot \frac{D^4}{\mu L} \cdot PCpipe(P)=128π⋅μLD4⋅P 
where DDD is pipe diameter, LLL length, μ\muμ gas viscosity, and PPP pressure.
Network Combination
1Cnet=∑i1Ci\frac{1}{C_{net}} = \sum_{i} \frac{1}{C_i}Cnet1=i∑Ci1 
Delivered Pumping Speed
Sdel(P)=Sp(P)⋅Cnet(P)Sp(P)+Cnet(P)S_{del}(P) = \frac{S_p(P) \cdot C_{net}(P)}{S_p(P) + C_{net}(P)}Sdel(P)=Sp(P)+Cnet(P)Sp(P)⋅Cnet(P) Q(P)=Sdel(P)⋅PQ(P) = S_{del}(P) \cdot PQ(P)=Sdel(P)⋅P

2.2 Mixed-Gas Viscosity
Viscosity of multicomponent mixtures is computed by the Herning–Zipperer method [7]:
μmix(T)=∑iμi(T) xiMi∑ixiMi\mu_{mix}(T) = \frac{\sum_i \mu_i(T) \, x_i \sqrt{M_i}}{\sum_i x_i \sqrt{M_i}}μmix(T)=∑ixiMi∑iμi(T)xiMi 
where xix_ixi and MiM_iMi are mole fraction and molar mass. Each μi(T)\mu_i(T)μi(T) is temperature-dependent, modeled by the Sutherland law [2].

2.3 Non-Isothermal Model
Gas temperature along the exhaust line is modeled as:
T(x)=Tw+(Tin−Tw) exp⁡(−xLth)T(x) = T_w + (T_{in} - T_w) \, \exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{th}}\right)T(x)=Tw+(Tin−Tw)exp(−Lthx) 
where wall temperature TwT_wTw, inlet temperature TinT_{in}Tin, and thermal relaxation length:
Lth=m˙cpπ Nu kL_{th} = \frac{\dot{m} c_p}{\pi \, Nu \, k}Lth=πNukm˙cp 
This couples mass flow rate m˙\dot{m}m˙ with temperature profile.

2.4 Fixed-Point Iteration
Because viscosity depends on temperature and temperature depends on flow rate, throughput becomes self-referential:
m˙→Lth→T(x)→μ(T)→Ctot(P)→Q(P)→m˙\dot{m} \to L_{th} \to T(x) \to \mu(T) \to C_{tot}(P) \to Q(P) \to \dot{m}m˙→Lth→T(x)→μ(T)→Ctot(P)→Q(P)→m˙ 
A fixed-point iteration is used:
m˙(k+1)=f(m˙(k))\dot{m}^{(k+1)} = f(\dot{m}^{(k)})m˙(k+1)=f(m˙(k)) 
Convergence criterion:
∣m˙(k+1)−m˙(k)∣m˙(k)<ε\frac{|\dot{m}^{(k+1)} - \dot{m}^{(k)}|}{\dot{m}^{(k)}} < \varepsilonm˙(k)∣m˙(k+1)−m˙(k)∣<ε
